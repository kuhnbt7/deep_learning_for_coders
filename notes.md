### Chapter 1

1943 - Mcculloch and Pitts model an artificial neuron

Frank Rosenblatt improved upon their idea and modeled the perceptron.

Then neural nets were kind of forgotten about for awhile, or development slowed anyways. They were 'rediscovered' in 1986 with a book called Parallel Data Processing. t laid out the requirements for modern neural nets.

The approach of this book is the same as the fast.ai approach - don't get bogged down in theory. Start out by showing examples, get your hands dirty, etc. Then explain the theory afterwards when it's easier to comprehend.

**It's important to use your own use cases to apply what is learned in the book**
